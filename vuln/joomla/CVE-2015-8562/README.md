# Joomla 3.4.5 Remote Code Execution Vulnability(CVE-2015-8562)

## Introduction

The docker envrioment was based on [vulnhub](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub/blob/master/joomla/CVE-2015-8562/docker-compose.yml).

I have modified it to work on `arm` platform for m1 serials chip.

Typically, you can use this for **Joomla 3.4.5/3.4.6 Remote Code Execution Vulnability**.

## Usage

Run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Access `http://localhost:8080` to install the joomla when your first start the container. Step next and setup the db info:

* db address: mysql:3306
* db user: root
* db password: root
* db name: joomla

After installation, you can connect to `mysql` (since the `3306` of mysql service has exported.) to inspcet the table for analyze this vulnability.
